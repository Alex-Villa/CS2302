I thought this program was really well planned out, I was able to manually trace the code and
see how it runs to your desired outcome. The only part I was slightly confused on was one of
your methods because you commeneted it was provided but not used. Rather when I was going through
the code I thought it was used. besided that I thoguht how you went about with coding and the
recursion were well thought out and straight foward where you can tell wha the code is suppose to do.
